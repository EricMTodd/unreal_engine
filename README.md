## NOTES

Every C++ program requires int main() function

DON'T FORGET TO RUN THE DEVELOPER CONSOLE AS AN ADMIN, OR YOUR PROGRAMS WON'T COMPILE!!!

You may see unnecessary warnings when compiling your program on Windows. If you would like to remove these warnings, follow the steps below.

### Instead of compiling with:

cl triplex.cpp

Try adding /EHsc to the end of the command:
cl triplex.cpp /EHsc
